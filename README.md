Allows the player to name the summon item of any pet, so that the pet will show its name when hovered over it (similar to how NPCs show their name)

How to use:
* Either open your chat (default: Enter), then left click on a summon item (so it sticks to your cursor), or hold an item in your cursor and then open your chat
* The chat will then say "/renamepet ", the following words you type in will be accepted as the new pet name
* It will also save the name of the player that gave the pet its last nickname
* To remove the name, simply type "reset" as the name 

Notes:
* Pet names will be saved on the item, even when disabling the mod and enabling it again
* Multiplayer compatible
* Compatible with most modded pets if they do it the vanilla way:
    * If a summon item happens to summon multiple different pets at once, only one of them will be named
    * If the pet name hover text only shows up in a specific position, contact that other mods dev so he can fix the pets hitbox

Example:

`/renamepet Cute Bunny` >> sets or renames the name of the pet item you are holding to "Cute Bunny"

`/renamepet reset` >> deletes the current name

 Changelog:

 v1.0 and 1.0.0.1: Initial release and added icon
