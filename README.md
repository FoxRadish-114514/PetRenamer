Allows the player to name the summon item of any pet, so that the pet will show its name when hovered over it (similar to how NPCs show their name)

How to use:
* Either open your chat (default: Enter) while you have a summon item held in your mouse (left click on the item in your inventory), or hold an item in your mouse and then open your chat
* The chat will then say "/renamepet ", the following words you type in will be accepted as the new pet name
* It will also save the original owner of the pet if it didn't have a name before, meaning that other players can't change it
* To remove the name, simply type "del" or "delete" as the name 

Notes:
* Pet names will be saved on the item, even when disabling the mod and enabling it again
* Multiplayer compatible
* Compatible with most modded pets if they do it the vanilla way:
    * If a summon item happens to summon multiple different pets at once, only one of them will be named
    * If the pet name hover text only shows up in a specific position, contact the mod dev so he can fix the pets hitbox

Example:

`/renamepet Cute Bunny` >> sets or renames the name of the pet item you are holding to "Cute Bunny"

`/renamepet del` >> deletes the current name
